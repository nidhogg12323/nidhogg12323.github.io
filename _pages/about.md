ðŸŽ“ **Yiheng Yao**  
Master's student at the University of Tokyo.  
My research interests lie primarily in:

- Time Series Forecasting  
- Domain Generalization  
- Robust Machine Learning under Distribution Shift

Welcome to my academic homepage.

I am currently conducting research on building models that can effectively learn from and adapt to temporal dynamics and cross-domain scenarios. My work focuses on improving generalization and robustness in real-world machine learning systems, especially in contexts where data distributions change over time or differ across domains.

Here you will find my CV, publications, teaching experience, research projects, and occasional blog posts.

Feel free to get in touch via the contact links on the sidebar if you're interested in collaboration or discussion.
